YOU AGREE THAT YOU WILL NOT IN ANY WAY HOLD HexTrack APP RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY SELECTION OR RETENTION OF, OR THE ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF, THIRD PARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE HexTrack App SERVICE.

 

Because some states prohibit the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states the limitation of liability only with respect to consequential or incidental damages may not apply to you, and the respective liability of HexTrack App and its agents, employees, distributors and agents is limited to the greatest extent allowable under applicable law in those states.

 

In the event that a court or arbitration panel, as the case may be, should hold that the limitations of liabilities or remedies available as set forth in this Agreement, or any portions thereof, are unenforceable for any reason, or that any of your remedies under these Terms of use fail, then you expressly agree that under no circumstances will the total, aggregate liability of HexTrack App and its agents, employees, distributors, agents or affiliates, to you or any party claiming by or through you for any cause whatsoever, exceed $100 (U.S.), regardless of the form of action and whether in contract, statute, tort or otherwise.

 

LINKS AND ACCESS TO THIRD-PARTY AND AFFILIATED SITES

 

LINKS FOUND IN THE HexTrack App SERVICE MAY LET YOU LEAVE THE HexTrack APP SERVICE TO ENTER OTHER SITES. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SUCH LINKED SITES ARE NOT UNDER THE CONTROL OF HexTrack APP, AND HexTrack APP IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONTENTS OF ANY LINKED SITE OR ANY LINK CONTAINED IN A LINKED SITE, OR ANY CHANGES OR UPDATES TO SUCH SITES. HexTrack App IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR WEBCASTING OR ANY OTHER FORM OF TRANSMISSION RECEIVED FROM ANY LINKED SITE. HexTrack APP IS PROVIDING THESE LINKS TO YOU ONLY AS A CONVENIENCE, AND THE INCLUSION OF ANY LINK DOES NOT IMPLY ENDORSEMENT OF THE SITE BY HexTrack APP.

 

HexTrack App does not offer trading services. However, due to the design of the HexTrack App Service, some features, such as trading offered by HexTrack,com and HexTrack.us, may appear seamlessly integrated with the HexTrack App Service for your convenience. For example, when you use the HexTrack App Trading feature and click the “trade” button, you may be linked to a third-party or affiliated site (“Other Site”), such as the HexTrack or the HexTrack US website and services. When you first access the HexTrack App Trading feature, you are leaving the HexTrack App Service and entering the Other Site. As a result, you are no longer using the HexTrack App Service, but rather using the service(s) of the Other Site.  HexTrack App is not responsible for any issues that you may have with the trading services.

 

You agree that once you leave the HexTrack App Service and enter Other Sites, you are bound by the terms of use or terms of service as well as the privacy policy of the Other Sites. In no way is HexTrack App responsible for the terms of use or privacy policy of other linked sites nor does HexTrack App have any control or influence over the terms of Other Sites. It is your sole responsibility to read and understand the terms of use and privacy policy of Other Sites before accessing or continuing to use the services of Other Sites.

 

INDEMNIFICATION

 

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless HexTrack App, its affiliates and their respective owners, directors, officers, employees, and agents from and against all Federal, State, and International, claims, demands, losses, costs, and/or expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of the use of the HexTrack App Service by you or by your account on the HexTrack App Service.

 

TERMINATION

 

HexTrack App shall have the right to immediately terminate your account in the event of any conduct by you that HexTrack App, in its sole discretion, considers to be unacceptable, or in the event of any breach by you of these Terms of Use.
